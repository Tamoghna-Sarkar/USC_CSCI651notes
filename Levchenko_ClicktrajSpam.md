#  Key Ideas:
- characterize spam
- how?
  - millions of messages from different feeds
  - resolved the messages to websites  
  - classified spams websites into domains that sell similar products
  -  ordering products, see where they come from and how they are paid

## there are lots of steps to do this SPAM PIPELINE (the attacker)

# Diversity in hosting:
- they identify affiliate programs and say that these 100 websites are just 1 company running the wwhole thing, and for each affiliate programs they are looking at AS and registrars, where **ASes are hosting them and Registrars are running DNS** 

- the y- axis is log scale.

- most people  dont have a lot of diversity, this graph can help to catch and shut down the major DNS and registrars that host majority of these spam companies

# but its easy for these companies to migrate to a different DNS and registrars because its easy
