# key stuff
- internet use went up during covid
- internet reacted okay
-data from Facebook

__facebook had stuff planned earlier in case of emergencies which helped them react easily when the network traffic went up suddenly__

### fig 1
    - the lockdowns at diff times - the vertical lines coming down
    - the horizontal ones are the day by day and the moving average over weeks
    - variations because people use fb at different times and go to sleep differently, so a smooth moving averge
    - the long term traffic increased, they looked specifically at the increase in traffic during lockdown
    - this continued for a while which was 

### fig2 
    - they broke traffic growth down by different locations to correlate lockdown dates in different regions

# what did facebook say about wired or wireless?
    - broadband wired went up more, because home networks went up

# bad session rate
    - buffering, downgraded video frame rate around march-april, and india baseline was worse, MORE CONGESTION IN LOCKDOWN  
    -VIDEO QUALITY IS A LEADING INDICATOR OF NETWORK PROBLEMS
        - population is dense
        - INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT STRONG IN INDIA??(wth)//LESS robust
        - India is a lesser wealthier country than US [please make me laugh about how US is advanced]
# Overflow traffic
    -Private Networks: its free and less expensive than transit where they pay somebody
**what to learn from this**
    -they did handle it okayish way, but they need more capacity in case of requirements
    - Observation: It also shows how to capacity they run
    - next weeks they tried to bring up new ckts

# congestion outside fb- RTT
    - another metric shows same kind of trend
        - but does show that network handled it well
