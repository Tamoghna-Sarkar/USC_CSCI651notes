# onion routing: 
- send network traffic through layers of annonymity to annonymize the user
- not a new idea("second generation")
- **new goals**

- integrity checking

- congestion 

- **they build a specific mechanism**

- circuits: to try to spread out setup cost and help w congestion control

- routed through multiple hops: to provide annonymity

- **they also annonymize servers**

# Goals:

- low-latency
- usable for web browsing
- relatively simple
only TCP

# Non-Goals
- not UDP
- not P2P
    -  complicated


# backwards annonymity requires and depends on re-mapping the IDS
# forwards annonymity depends on encryption
## 2 things going on.
